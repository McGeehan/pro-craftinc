    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro-Craft Inc's headquarters have an interesting history. It was once used as Cotton Yarn Mill during the 1800s. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Irving erected the mill that houses Pro-Craft in 1860.  Then, in 1878, Irving's company was incorporated under the law of the State of Pennsylvania as the Irving & Leiper Manufacturing Company. There, cotton yarns and fabrics were manufactured and sold.<br>
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Casciato Electric completed electrical maintenance work in the 1950s. The Mill was built along the creek and had water run through the building where a water wheel powered the line shafts that allowed the machines to operate.
